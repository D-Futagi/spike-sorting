# Spike sorting with misalignment adjustment
## Introduction

the spike sorting code is written in Python 3 and developed in OS X 10.15. 
## Demonstration
We show an example of spike sorting using simulated data. The demostration code (demo.ipynb) is in Jupyter notebook format and can be browsed in https://github.com/D-Futagi/spike-sorting/blob/master/demo.ipynb. In the code, the process for spike sorting is carried out step by step. The simulated data in this repository was produced by Qurigoa et al. and is available in sitespike.g-node.org. Details of the data can be found in: 

Quiroga, R. Q., Nadasdy, Z. & Ben-Shaul, Y. Unsupervised spike detection and sorting with wavelets and superparamagnetic clustering. Neural Comput. 16(8), 1661-1687 (2004).

Note that the code for spike sorting in this repository only support the simulated data proposed by Quiroga et al.
