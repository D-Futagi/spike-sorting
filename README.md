# Spike sorting with misalignment adjustment
## Introduction

the spike sorting code is written in Python 3 and developed in OS X 10.15. 
## Demonstration
We show an example of spike sorting using simulated data. This demostration code (demo.ipynb) is run in Jupyter notebook or Jupyter lab. The simulated data in this repository was produced by Qurigoa et al. and is available in sitespike.g-node.org. Details can be found in:
