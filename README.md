# Spike sorting with misalignment adjustment
## Introduction

the spike sorting code is written in Python 3 and developed in OS X 10.15.
## Demonstration
We by using simulated data. The simulated data was produced by Qurigoa et al. Details can be found in: 
Quiroga, R. Q., Nadasdy, Z. & Ben-Shaul, Y. Unsupervised spike detection and sorting with wavelets and superparamagnetic clustering. Neural Comput. 16(8), 1661-1687 (2004).

uploaded data is downloaded from pike.g-node.org.
